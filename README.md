# mini-hotkeyboard

This is a smaller version of the last hotkey keyboard that I made. This time, instead of repurposing an old cash register keyboard, I made a new one from scratch. This allowed me to make a compact layout, and add additional toggle switches. The board was designed to fit a project box that I had laying around.
The project was designed as a Christmas gift for a friend of mine, who wanted some hotkeys to make writing her assignments more efficient.

Functional layout:
| | A |	B | C | D | E |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Caps Lock (switch) | Change style to “Normal” (button in knob) | Volume mute (button in knob) | Types “asdf” (switch) | -- |
| 2 | Increase font size | Paragraph indent | Change style to “Heading 1” | Change style to “Heading 2” | Change style to “Heading 3” |
| 3 | Decrease font size | Remove paragraph indent | Bullet point | En dash | Em dash |
